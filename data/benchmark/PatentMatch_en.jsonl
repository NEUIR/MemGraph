The preparation method for the oil powder is: selectively adding a mono- or diglyceride fatty acid ester to the medium chain triglyceride to produce an oil phase solution; dissolving the low-GI carrier, and selectively adding sodium caseinate to produce a water phase solution; emulsifying and homogenizing the oil phase solution and the water phase solution, and spray drying.\nB: A method for preparing a drug-loaded silk fibroin nanocapsule, and a prepared drug-loaded silk fibroin nanocapsule. The method comprises: carrying out a coating treatment of applying alternating layers of silk fibroin and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane to functionally modified polystyrene microspheres, to ultimately obtain a multi-layer-structured coated polystyrene composite with a negative or positive potential, and finally removing the functionally modified polystyrene template with a template-removing reagent, to obtain a drug-loaded silk fibroin nanocapsule. The functionally modified polystyrene microspheres are positive potential microspheres, and silk fibroin is used for the first coating. In the case of negative potential microspheres, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane is used for the first treatment. The process is simple and has wide applicability. The dimensions of the prepared microcapsule can be controlled at the nanometer level, so that the microcapsule can more effectively transport a drug to the interior of a cell to function, and the surface potential of the microcapsule can be regulated according to the properties of the drug so as to enhance electrostatic adsorption and improve the effective drug loading rate.\nC: A highly uniform sulphide microsphere with precisely controllable particle size and a preparation method therefor.

In the first growth step, sulphide nanospheres with stable particle size are obtained by means of stable reaction conditions; in the subsequent steps, the particle size of the nanospheres can be precisely controlled by means of controlling the timing and amount of the addition of the metal and sulphur source. According to said synthesis method, by means of a preset target particle size and precisely designing the experiment steps, sulphide nanospheres of the target particle size can be obtained; in addition, the adjustable particle size range of the present method is significantly increased, the adjustable range being 100 nm-1000 nm.\nD: Relating to skin microspheres, a preparation method therefor, and an application thereof.

Furthermore, the inner core and outer shell each carry a signal pathway activity reporting system, such that the skin microspheres can promptly respond to the effect of a sample to be tested, thereby detecting the effect of the sample on the epidermal layer and/or dermal layer.", "input": "", "output": "A"}

In the method, multiple characters are written continuously without pauses; when character number i+2 is being written, character number i disappears automatically from the display screen, and the color of character i+1 is dimmed automatically.
